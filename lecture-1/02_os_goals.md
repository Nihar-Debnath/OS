### 1. **Less Process Starvation**

#### üîç What is "Process Starvation"?
**Starvation** happens when a **process waits indefinitely** to get CPU time or access to a resource because other processes are constantly being favored.

#### ‚úÖ "Less process starvation" means:
The OS should **fairly schedule all processes**, ensuring **even low-priority or background tasks** eventually get a chance to execute.

#### üß† Example:
Imagine an OS where only high-priority processes get CPU time. A download manager (low priority) may **never run** because the CPU is always busy with video editing software (high priority). This is starvation.

So the OS uses strategies like **aging** to gradually increase the priority of waiting processes ‚Äî reducing starvation.


### 2. **Higher Priority Job Execution**

#### üîç What is "Higher Priority Job Execution"?
Some processes are more important or time-sensitive than others. The OS should ensure that **high-priority processes get CPU time faster** than lower-priority ones.

#### ‚úÖ This means:
The OS scheduler should **prefer processes** marked with higher priority so they can run **sooner and more frequently**.

#### üß† Example:
A **real-time video call app** should get priority over a background virus scan. If both are ready to run, the video app should be scheduled first to avoid lag.


### ‚öñÔ∏è Balancing Both:
These two goals often **conflict**:
- Giving too much priority to important tasks may cause starvation of others.
- Treating all processes equally may delay critical tasks.

So, the OS must **balance** them using smart scheduling algorithms like **Multilevel Queue**, **Priority Scheduling with Aging**, etc.
