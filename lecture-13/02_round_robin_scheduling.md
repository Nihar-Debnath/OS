Let's now explain **Round Robin (RR) CPU Scheduling** in a **very beginner-friendly** and **detailed** way, just like we did for the others.

# 🧭 What is Round Robin (RR) Scheduling?

> Think of RR like a **turn-based game** or **queue in a bank**: everyone gets a fixed time to play/work, and if they don’t finish, they go back to the end of the line and wait for their turn again.

It is one of the **most popular and fair** scheduling algorithms.

### 🔹 5. Round Robin Scheduling (RR)

### 📌 a. **Most Popular**
- Widely used in **general-purpose operating systems** like Windows, Linux, etc.
- Loved for its **fairness** and **simplicity**.

### 📌 b. **Like FCFS but Preemptive**
- FCFS = First Come, First Serve.
- In FCFS, a process once started runs until it finishes.
- In RR, a process **runs for a fixed time**, then **goes back** to the queue if not finished.
- This makes RR **preemptive** – it **interrupts** processes and gives everyone a fair slice of CPU.

### 📌 c. **Made for Time-Sharing Systems**
- RR is **perfect for modern operating systems** where multiple users/programs share CPU time.
- Each process gets a **time quantum (TQ)** – a small fixed time slice (e.g., 100ms).
- Feels like all programs are running at once, even if CPU handles them one at a time.

### 📌 d. **Criteria = Arrival Time (AT) + Time Quantum (TQ)**
- Unlike SJF or Priority Scheduling, it **does NOT care** about the process’s **Burst Time (BT)**.
- Only Arrival Time and **TQ** matter.

### 📌 e. **Low Starvation, No Convoy Effect**
- **No process waits forever** because everyone gets a turn.
- No one process hogs the CPU.
- There’s **no convoy effect** like in FCFS, where a big job blocks smaller ones.

### 📌 f. **Easy to Implement**
- Logic is simple:
  - Keep a **queue**,
  - Give each process CPU for **TQ** time,
  - If not finished, put it **back in the queue**.

### 📌 g. **Context Switch Overhead**
- If **TQ is too small**, CPU keeps switching between processes frequently.

> 🧠 This switch is called a **context switch** – where the CPU saves one process’s state and loads another’s.

- More switches = more **overhead** = slower system.
- So, **TQ must be chosen wisely**: not too small, not too big.

## 🔁 🔄 Round Robin Flow (Explaining the Diagram)

Let’s break down the diagram step by step:

1. **Ready Queue**: List of processes waiting to run.

2. **Pick a Process (FCFS)**: First process in queue is selected.

3. **Check: Is Burst Time < Time Quantum?**
   - Yes ➝ Process is so short it can finish in one go.
     - So it's allowed to **run till completion**.
   - No ➝ Process needs more time.
     - It runs for **TQ only**, then...

4. **TQ Expires ➝ Check: Is Process Done?**
   - Yes ➝ Move to **Terminate State** (done).
   - No ➝ Put back in queue to wait for next round.

👉 This loop continues until **all processes are done**.

## ✅ Advantages of RR

| Feature                     | Benefit                                     |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Fairness                   | All processes treated equally                |
| Low starvation             | No process is left out                      |
| Fast response              | Ideal for interactive systems (like GUI apps) |
| Simple design              | Easy to code and understand                 |

## ❌ Disadvantages

| Problem                    | Reason                                  |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| High overhead             | Too many context switches if TQ is small |
| Not ideal for long jobs   | Long jobs take multiple rounds to finish |
| Tuning TQ is tricky       | Too small = slow, too big = unfair       |

## 🛠️ Why Do We Need Round Robin?

- Operating systems often need to serve **multiple users and programs** at once.
- RR makes it feel like everything runs **simultaneously**, thanks to **frequent switches**.
- It ensures:
  - **No program is starved**
  - **Interactive apps respond quickly**
  - **System remains fair and predictable**

### ❓ **Question:**

Consider the following set of processes with their arrival times and burst times. Use **Round Robin scheduling** with a **Time Quantum (TQ) = 4 units**.

| Process | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
| ------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| P1      | 0                 | 10              |
| P2      | 1                 | 4               |
| P3      | 2                 | 5               |
| P4      | 3                 | 3               |

**Find:**

1. Completion Time (CT) of each process
2. Turnaround Time (TAT) = CT - AT
3. Waiting Time (WT) = TAT - BT
4. Average Turnaround Time and Average Waiting Time

### ✅ **Solution:**

**Step 1: Create a Gantt Chart using Round Robin (TQ = 4)**

We use a queue to keep track of processes. At each step, we execute a process for up to 4 units or until it finishes.

Let’s simulate it:

| Time  | Process | Remark            |
| ----- | ------- | ----------------- |
| 0-4   | P1      | 10 → 6 left       |
| 4-8   | P2      | 4 → 0 (completed) |
| 8-11  | P3      | 5 → 2 left        |
| 11-14 | P4      | 3 → 0 (completed) |
| 14-18 | P1      | 6 → 2 left        |
| 18-20 | P3      | 2 → 0 (completed) |
| 20-22 | P1      | 2 → 0 (completed) |

**Step 2: Completion Times (CT)**

* P1 → finishes at 22
* P2 → finishes at 8
* P3 → finishes at 20
* P4 → finishes at 14

**Step 3: Turnaround Time (TAT = CT - AT)**

* P1 → 22 - 0 = **22**
* P2 → 8 - 1 = **7**
* P3 → 20 - 2 = **18**
* P4 → 14 - 3 = **11**

**Step 4: Waiting Time (WT = TAT - BT)**

* P1 → 22 - 10 = **12**
* P2 → 7 - 4 = **3**
* P3 → 18 - 5 = **13**
* P4 → 11 - 3 = **8**

### 📊 **Final Answer Summary:**

| Process | CT | TAT | WT |
| ------- | -- | --- | -- |
| P1      | 22 | 22  | 12 |
| P2      | 8  | 7   | 3  |
| P3      | 20 | 18  | 13 |
| P4      | 14 | 11  | 8  |

**Average TAT** = (22 + 7 + 18 + 11) / 4 = **14.5**
**Average WT** = (12 + 3 + 13 + 8) / 4 = **9**
