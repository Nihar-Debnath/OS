### 1. **Single Process Operating System**

🖥️ **Example:** MS-DOS (1981)

* Runs **one program at a time**.
* No multitasking.
* Simple and small in size.
* Used in early personal computers.

> ❗ Limitation: You can’t browse the web and listen to music at the same time.

---

### 2. **Batch Processing Operating System**

📦 **Example:** ATLAS (Late 1950s, Manchester University)

* Users submit **jobs (programs with data)** in batches (often via punch cards).
* OS executes jobs **one by one without user interaction**.
* Efficient for large, repetitive jobs like payroll processing.

> 🕒 You submit your task, go for tea, and return to collect the result.

### 🔄 What is Multiprogramming?

**Multiprogramming** means keeping **multiple jobs** (programs) in memory at the same time, so the **CPU can work on another job** when one is waiting (e.g., for input/output like reading from disk or waiting for user input).


### 📌 Key Features (from your text):

1. **Single CPU**

   * Only **one CPU** executes **one job at a time**, but it **switches** between jobs when needed.

2. **Context Switching**

   * When one process **pauses (e.g., waiting for I/O)**, the OS saves its state (context) and **loads another job's state** so it can run next.

3. **Switch Happens on Wait State**

   * The switch happens only when the **current process can’t continue**, like waiting for a file to load.

4. **CPU Idle Time Reduced**

   * Instead of sitting idle while one job waits, the **CPU does useful work** by running another job.


### 💡 Real-World Example:

Let’s say you're a **chef** 👨‍🍳 in a kitchen with:

* **Order 1:** Boil pasta (takes 10 mins, water must boil)
* **Order 2:** Chop vegetables (can be done immediately)
* **Order 3:** Make dough (takes 5 mins to rest)


### 🔁 Without Multiprogramming:

* You **start boiling water**, and just **wait 10 mins doing nothing**.
* Total time = very long. CPU (chef) is idle during waits.


### ✅ With Multiprogramming:

* Start boiling water for pasta (starts waiting).
* While waiting, **switch to chopping vegetables**.
* Then start kneading dough.
* When water boils, **switch back** to pasta.

Now, the **chef is always busy**, making full use of time — just like the **CPU** in multiprogramming.

## 💻 What is a **Multitasking Operating System**?

A **Multitasking OS** allows a **single user** to run **multiple tasks (processes)** at the same time on a **single CPU** system.

### 📌 Key Features:

* All programs **appear to run at the same time**.
* The CPU rapidly **switches between tasks**, giving the **illusion of parallelism**.
* This switching is done in **very small time slices** (fractions of a second).


## 🤔 But What If **No Process is Waiting for I/O**?

Let’s suppose:

* All tasks are **pure CPU-bound** (no I/O waiting).
* Each task wants the CPU **non-stop**.

### 🔁 How does the OS handle this?

The OS uses a **technique called time-sharing** (or **preemptive multitasking**):


### 🔄 **Time-Sharing in Multitasking OS**

* The CPU is **divided into fixed time slices**, like 10 milliseconds.
* Each process is given a **turn** (also called a **time quantum**).
* After the time slice ends, the OS **interrupts** the running process.
* Then, it **saves its state (context switching)** and **gives the CPU to the next process**.

> This way, **every process gets a fair share**, even if none are doing I/O.


### 💡 Real-World Example: Pizza Shop Analogy

Imagine:

* One chef 🧑‍🍳 (CPU)
* Three customers with complex orders (processes)
* Each customer can only talk for 1 minute (time slice)

The chef talks to Customer 1 for 1 minute, then **interrupts**, talks to Customer 2, then 3, then **back to 1** — repeating the cycle.

Even if none of the customers pause, each one gets a fair amount of attention **without being greedy**.

### 5. **Multiprocessing Operating System**

🖥️🖥️ **Example:** Windows NT

* Uses **more than one CPU (processor)**.
* Multiple processes can run **truly simultaneously**.
* Increases speed and reliability.

> 💡 Like having two cooks working in the same kitchen—things get done faster.

---

### 6. **Distributed Operating System**

🌐 **Example:** LOCUS

* **Multiple computers** connected over a network act like **one system**.
* Resources (CPU, storage) shared across machines.
* If one fails, others can take over (fault-tolerant).

> 💻🖥️🖥️ Like Google’s cloud servers handling one search from many machines.

---

### 7. **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**

⏱️ **Example:** ATCS (Air Traffic Control Systems)

* Designed to **respond immediately** to input.
* Used in systems where **timing is critical** (missile systems, robots, medical devices).
* Can be **Hard RTOS** (strict timing) or **Soft RTOS** (some flexibility).

> 🚨 Delays in airbag deployment = disaster → RTOS prevents that.




## 🧾 Real-Time = **Error-Free + On-Time**

### ✅ Real-Time OS ensures:

* **Accurate (error-free) computation**
* **Execution within strict time limits** (called *deadlines*)

If the system **misses the deadline**, the result is considered **useless** — even if it's correct.

### 🧠 What does this mean?

> It’s not just about being **fast**, it’s about being **predictable** and **on time** every time.

### 🔧 Real-World Examples:

#### ✈️ **Air Traffic Control System**

* Tracks hundreds of flights in real time.
* A 1-second delay in radar data or commands can cause **collisions** or chaos.
* RTOS ensures **instant, reliable response** to changes in aircraft positions.

#### 🤖 **Robots (e.g., surgical or industrial robots)**

* Must react to sensor inputs or control arms **in milliseconds**.
* If delayed, even slightly, it could **damage equipment** or **harm humans**.
* RTOS ensures **each motion happens at the exact planned time**.
