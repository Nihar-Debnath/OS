## üõ†Ô∏è 4. Solution to Race Condition

### a. **Atomic Operations**

* Atomic = **All or nothing**.
* These operations **cannot be interrupted** while executing.
* Done in **a single CPU step**, so no thread can "jump in" halfway.

üß† Example:

In c++ we can create a atomic variable for **count++** like this:

```cpp
__atomic_add(&counter, 1);  // Atomic increment
```

Only one thread can change `counter` at a time.

---

### b. **Mutual Exclusion (Mutex) Using Locks**

* A lock is like a **"room key"** for the critical section.
* Only one thread can enter (run that part of code) if it **has the key (lock)**.
* Others have to **wait** outside.

üß† Example (in C++):

In c++ **mutex** is used for locks

```cpp
#include <mutex>
mutex m;

void critical_section() {
    m.lock();   // Take the key
    // Work with shared data
    m.unlock(); // Return the key
}
```

---

### c. What is a Semaphore?

A **semaphore** is a synchronization tool used to control access to a shared resource in concurrent programming (like multiple threads or processes).

* Think of it like a **traffic signal or a ticket system** that regulates how many threads can enter a critical section (CS) or access a resource at a time.
* Semaphores help **avoid race conditions** by ensuring that only a limited number of threads can execute a piece of code simultaneously.


### Types of Semaphores:

1. **Binary Semaphore (Mutex):**

   * Can only be 0 or 1.
   * It works like a lock:

     * If the semaphore is 1 (unlocked), a thread can enter the CS and sets it to 0 (locked).
     * When leaving the CS, the thread sets it back to 1 (unlocked).
   * Only one thread can enter the critical section at a time.

2. **Counting Semaphore:**

   * Holds a count representing the number of available resources or permits.
   * Threads decrement the count to enter, and increment it when they leave.


### How does a Semaphore solve race condition?

Using a **binary semaphore (mutex)**, threads must **wait** before entering the critical section if another thread is already inside. This **serializes access** to the critical section, preventing simultaneous updates that cause race conditions.

* When a thread wants to enter the CS, it does a **wait (P operation)** on the semaphore:

  * If the semaphore is 1, it becomes 0, and the thread enters the CS.
  * If it is 0, the thread waits (blocks) until the semaphore becomes 1 again.
* When leaving the CS, the thread does a **signal (V operation)**:

  * The semaphore is set back to 1, allowing another waiting thread to enter.


### Quick example of binary semaphore usage (pseudo-code):

```c
semaphore mutex = 1;

Thread() {
  wait(mutex);    // Request access (if mutex=1, continue; else wait)
  // Critical Section - only one thread allowed here at a time
  signal(mutex);  // Release access (mutex=1, allow others in)
}
```

### What is **Bounded Waiting** in Critical Section?

**Bounded waiting** means:

> There is a **limit on the number of times other threads can enter their critical sections** after a thread has requested to enter and before it gets the chance to enter.

In simpler terms:

* Suppose Thread A wants to enter the critical section.
* Bounded waiting guarantees that Thread A **won't wait forever** while other threads keep cutting in line.
* There's a maximum number of times other threads can jump ahead before Thread A is allowed in.

---

### Why is Bounded Waiting Important?

* Without bounded waiting, a thread can be **starved** (never get to enter its critical section).
* Bounded waiting ensures **fairness** ‚Äî no thread waits indefinitely.

## ‚ùå 5. Can a simple flag (like a boolean variable) solve race condition?

**No.**
Because:

* Flags themselves are shared data.
* Without proper control, **both threads can still enter at the same time** before the flag is updated properly.

### What is a simple flag here?

Imagine you have a shared boolean variable:

```c
bool flag = false;
```

And you try to use it like this to control access to a critical section:

```c
if (!flag) {
    flag = true;   // Indicate critical section is occupied
    // critical section code here
    flag = false;  // Leave critical section
}
```

### Why can‚Äôt this simple flag prevent race conditions?

The main reason is that **reading and writing the flag are not atomic and can be interleaved in problematic ways**. Let‚Äôs see an example.

### Problem example with two threads (Thread A and Thread B):

1. Both threads check `if (!flag)` at about the same time.

   * Since `flag` is initially `false`, **both see it as false** (meaning the CS is free).

2. Both threads enter the `if` block because the condition is true for both.

3. Thread A sets `flag = true` indicating it's in the critical section.
   Meanwhile, Thread B **hasn't updated the flag yet**, so it still thinks it's safe to enter.

4. Now **both Thread A and Thread B execute the critical section simultaneously**, causing race condition and data corruption.

### Why does this happen?

Because:

* The `if (!flag)` check and `flag = true` assignment are **two separate operations**, and there is **no guarantee they execute atomically** (all at once).
* Between the check and the set, **another thread can intervene** and also pass the check before the first thread sets the flag.
* This creates a **time window** where both threads think they have exclusive access, but actually don't.

### What‚Äôs missing here?

* There is **no synchronization or atomicity** to prevent the interleaving.
* A proper solution requires **atomic operations** or **locks/semaphores** that make the "check-and-set" action indivisible.

## ‚úÖ 6. Peterson's Solution (for 2 threads only)

This is a **classic algorithm** that:

* Lets **two threads** take turns.
* Ensures **only one** is in the critical section at a time.

üß† Very basic logic:

* Each thread says "I want to go!"
* But also says, "Let the other one go first if it's their turn."


---

**Peterson‚Äôs Solution** is a classic software-based algorithm that solves the **mutual exclusion problem** for **two processes (or threads)** without using hardware atomic instructions or semaphores. It guarantees:

* Mutual exclusion (only one thread in critical section at a time)
* Progress (no deadlock)
* Bounded waiting (no starvation)

## How Peterson‚Äôs Solution works and how it solves the race condition issue:

It uses **two shared variables:**

* `flag[2]` ‚Äî an array of booleans to indicate if a process wants to enter the critical section.
* `turn` ‚Äî an integer indicating whose turn it is to enter the critical section.

### Algorithm for two processes (Process 0 and Process 1):

Each process executes this before entering the critical section:

```c
flag[i] = true;          // Process i wants to enter critical section
turn = j;                // Give turn to the other process j
while (flag[j] == true && turn == j) {
    // Busy wait (do nothing) until the other process is not interested
}
```

After this wait finishes, Process `i` enters the critical section safely.

When done:

```c
flag[i] = false;         // Process i is leaving critical section
```

### Why does this solve the race condition?

1. **Mutual exclusion**:

   * Both processes can‚Äôt be in the critical section simultaneously.
   * If both want to enter, the `turn` variable gives priority to one process, forcing the other to wait.

2. **Progress**:

   * If one process is not interested (`flag[j] == false`), the other enters immediately.
   * So processes don‚Äôt wait unnecessarily.

3. **Bounded waiting**:

   * Because `turn` alternates and each process eventually gets its turn, no process waits forever.

### Step-by-step example:

* Suppose Process 0 wants to enter CS:

  * It sets `flag[0] = true`.
  * Sets `turn = 1` (gives turn to Process 1).
  * Checks if Process 1 wants to enter (`flag[1] == true`) and if it‚Äôs Process 1‚Äôs turn (`turn == 1`).
  * If Process 1 doesn‚Äôt want to enter or it‚Äôs not Process 1‚Äôs turn, Process 0 proceeds.

* If both try at the same time, `turn` decides who goes first, and the other waits.

### Why can't this be broken by context switches?

Because the **check and decision** (`while (flag[j] && turn == j)`) is inside a loop that keeps checking the condition until the other process backs off.

* The `turn` variable ensures **one process defers to the other** if both want to enter at once.
* The `flag` array ensures both processes **express interest** clearly.


### Visual analogy:

* Two friends want to enter a room.
* Both raise their hands (`flag[i] = true`) saying they want to enter.
* They decide who goes first by `turn`.
* The one whose turn it is enters while the other waits.
* After the first leaves, it lowers their hand (`flag[i] = false`), allowing the other in.


## But remember one thing Petersion solution also have problem that it only used for 2 threads max, we cant use it for more threads

- Not used much in real-world now, but good for **theory and understanding**.

Would you like a real-life **story analogy** to help lock and race condition make more sense?

## üç© The Donut Shop Analogy (Story)

### Characters:

* **Alice** and **Bob** are two co-workers.
* They share a **common fridge** at the office that sometimes has **exactly one donut** inside.
* They both love donuts. If there's a donut in the fridge, they want to eat it.


### The Race Condition (No Lock)

One morning, a donut is placed in the fridge. Alice and Bob both walk toward the fridge **at the same time**.

Here‚Äôs what happens:

1. **Alice opens the fridge and sees the donut.**
2. **Bob also opens the fridge and sees the donut.**
3. Both think: ‚ÄúYum! I‚Äôm going to take it.‚Äù
4. Alice and Bob both reach for the donut.
5. üí• **They grab the same donut at the same time.**
6. The donut is squished or both think they took it ‚Äî **confusion and a ruined snack**.

This is a **race condition** ‚Äî both tried to use a shared resource (the donut) at the same time **without coordination**.

### Adding a Lock (A Key System üîë)

To prevent donut disasters, the office installs a **lockable fridge door** and gives **one key** to be shared.

Here‚Äôs the new rule:

* If you want a donut, you **must take the key** before opening the fridge.
* If someone else has the key, you **wait until they return it**.

### What happens now:

1. Alice and Bob both go for the fridge.
2. Alice gets the key first.
3. Bob sees Alice has the key and **waits**.
4. Alice checks the fridge, finds the donut, eats it, and returns the key.
5. Bob takes the key, opens the fridge ‚Äî but the donut is gone.
6. No confusion, no squished donuts.

This is how **a lock (or mutex)** works ‚Äî only one person can **enter the critical section (the fridge)** at a time.

---

### Mapping the analogy to real computing concepts:

| Real Life                    | Computer Concept            |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| The fridge                   | Shared resource / memory    |
| The donut                    | Shared data (e.g., counter) |
| Alice & Bob                  | Threads or processes        |
| Both grabbing the donut      | Race condition              |
| The key to the fridge        | Lock / Mutex                |
| Waiting for the key          | Blocking or busy waiting    |
| Only one person using fridge | Mutual exclusion            |

### Bonus: What if there‚Äôs **no key and a sticky note instead**?

Imagine they use a note like:

> "Hey, I‚Äôm checking the fridge ‚Äî please wait! ‚Äì Alice"

This is like using a **flag variable**. But if Bob comes in **before Alice posts the note**, he doesn't know she‚Äôs about to enter, and they might **both enter at once** ‚Äî just like how a boolean flag fails to prevent race conditions if it's not atomic.

### Conclusion

* **Race conditions** happen when multiple "people" (threads) try to grab the same thing at once without coordination.
* **Locks** are tools (like a key) that ensure only one can enter at a time.
* **Without locks**, things get messy and unpredictable.
* **With proper locking**, everything is orderly ‚Äî even if you don‚Äôt get the donut üòÑ.
