### üìã Given Data

| Process | Priority | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
| ------- | -------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| P1      | 2        | 0                 | 4               |
| P2      | 4        | 1                 | 2               |
| P3      | 6        | 2                 | 3               |
| P4      | 10       | 3                 | 5               |
| P5      | 8        | 4                 | 1               |
| P6      | 12       | 5                 | 4               |
| P7      | 9        | 6                 | 6               |

**Note:** higher priority number = **higher actual priority**

### ‚úÖ Step-by-step Execution with Gantt Chart

#### üîπ t = 0

* Only P1 has arrived
* So run **P1**
* ‚è±Ô∏è Time: 0 ‚Üí 1 (This will run for 1 sec because the preemptive priority scheduler will check is there any other higher priority process)

| Process | Priority | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
| ------- | -------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| P1      | 2        | 0                 | 4 - 1 = 3       |

#### üîπ t = 1

* Arrived till now: P2
* So pick **P2**
* Run P2 from 1 ‚Üí 2 (same it will also run for 1 sec and checks the next process)

| Process | Priority | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
| ------- | -------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| P1      | 2        | 0                 | 4 - 1 = 3       |
| P2      | 4        | 1                 | 2 - 1 = 1       |


#### üîπ t = 2

* Now arrived: P3
* Available = P1, P2
* So pick **P3**
* Run P3 ‚Üí 2 to 3

| Process | Priority | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |

#### üîπ t = 3

* Now arrived: P4
* Remaining = P1, P2, P3
* So pick **P4**

#### üîπ t = 5

* Now arrived: P5 and P6
* Remaining = P1, P2, P3, P4
* Highest priority = **P6 (priority 12)**
* So pick **P6**
* Run P6 ‚Üí 5 to 9

| Process | Priority | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
