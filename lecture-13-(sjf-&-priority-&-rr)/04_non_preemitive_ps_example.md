**Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling**, meaning **once a process starts executing, it runs to completion**, and the **next process is chosen based on the highest priority** among the **arrived processes only**.

### üìã Given Data

| Process | Priority | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
| ------- | -------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| P1      | 2        | 0                 | 4               |
| P2      | 4        | 1                 | 2               |

### üß† Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling Logic

We simulate time from **t = 0** onward. At every time a process finishes, we:

* Check all **arrived processes**
* Select the one with **highest priority (lowest number)**
* Run it to **completion** (non-preemptive)

### ‚úÖ Step-by-step Execution with Gantt Chart

#### üîπ t = 0

* Only P1 has arrived
* So run **P1** (BT=4)
* ‚è±Ô∏è Time: 0 ‚Üí 4

#### üîπ t = 4

* Arrived till now: P2, P3, P4, P5
* Highest priority = **P4 (priority 10)**
* So pick **P4** (BT=5)
* Run P4 from 4 ‚Üí 9

#### üîπ t = 9

* Now arrived: P6, P7
* Available = P3, P4, P5, P6, P7
* Highest priority among them = **P6 (priority 12)**
* So pick **P6** (BT=4)
* Run P6 ‚Üí 9 to 13

#### üîπ t = 13

* Remaining = P2 (4), P3 (6), P5 (8), P7 (9)
* Highest priority = **P7 (priority 9)**
* So pick **P9** (BT=6)
* Run P9 ‚Üí 13 to 19

#### üîπ t = 19

* Remaining = P2 (4), P3 (6), P5 (8)
* Highest priority = **P5 (priority 8)**
* So pick **P5** (BT=1)
* Run P5 ‚Üí 19 to 20

#### üîπ t = 20

* Remaining = P2 (4), P3 (6)
* Highest priority = **P3 (priority 6)**
* So pick **P3** (BT=3)
* Run P3 ‚Üí 20 to 23

#### üîπ t = 23

* Remaining = P2 (4)
* Highest priority = **P2 (priority 4)**
* So pick **P2** (BT=2)
* Run P2 ‚Üí 23 to 25

\| WT Sum = 0 + 22 + 19 + 1 + 15 + 4 + 7 = 68 |
\| Count = 7 processes |
\| Avg WT = 68 / 7 = **9.71** ‚úÖ |
