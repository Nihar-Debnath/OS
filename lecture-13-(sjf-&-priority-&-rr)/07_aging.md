> i think you are telling wrong because the higher the priority number is the higher the priority

You're absolutely right to point that out ‚Äî thank you!
Let's **correct and clarify** everything based on that:

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Correction: Priority Number Meaning

In **some systems**, **higher number = higher priority** (e.g., priority 12 > priority 4).
In **other systems**, it's the opposite: **lower number = higher priority** (e.g., priority 1 > priority 5).

* So, **higher number = higher priority** in your case.
* Dont get confused

---

## ‚úÖ Now, What is **Aging** (With Correct Priority Direction)

**Aging** is a technique to **prevent starvation** in **priority scheduling**, where some processes might be **ignored forever** due to their **low priority**.

---

### üîß How Aging Works (Corrected for Your Case):

* In your system, **higher number = higher priority**
* So, with **aging**, the system **gradually increases the priority number** of waiting processes.

#### Example:

* A process starts at priority **4** (lower)
* After waiting for some time, its priority increases like this:

  * After 1 sec ‚Üí priority 5
  * After 2 sec ‚Üí priority 6
  * ...
* Eventually, it becomes **high enough** (e.g., priority 10 or 12) to compete with other processes and gets scheduled.

---

### üìä Solving Starvation

| Without Aging                         | With Aging                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Low-priority process may wait forever | Its priority increases over time         |
| High-priority ones keep preempting    | Eventually, the waiting process gets CPU |
| Starvation occurs                     | Starvation is prevented                  |

---

### üß† Works in Both:

* **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**: A waiting process‚Äôs priority rises, and it can eventually preempt others.
* **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling**: A low-priority process eventually gets chosen once its aged priority surpasses others.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Summary

* ‚úîÔ∏è **Aging = gradually increasing a waiting process's priority** over time.
* ‚úîÔ∏è In **your system**: this means **increasing the priority number**.
* ‚úîÔ∏è It **prevents starvation** by ensuring all processes eventually get the CPU.

## ‚úÖ What is **Aging** in Operating Systems?

**Aging** is a technique used to **prevent starvation** in **priority scheduling** (both preemptive and non-preemptive).
It does this by **gradually increasing the priority** of a process the **longer it waits** in the ready queue.

---

### üîß **How does it work?**

Imagine a process starts with a **low priority** (e.g., 10).
For every **unit of time it waits**, its priority number is **decreased** (since lower number = higher priority).

* ‚è±Ô∏è After 1 second ‚Üí Priority becomes 9
* ‚è±Ô∏è After 2 seconds ‚Üí Priority becomes 8
* ... and so on.

Eventually, its priority will be **high enough** that it **gets selected** for execution ‚Äî **ending the starvation**.

### üìä How Aging Solves Starvation:

| Without Aging                         | With Aging                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Low-priority process may wait forever | Priority increases over time          |
| High-priority processes always win    | Eventually, every process gets a turn |
| Starvation is possible                | Starvation is prevented               |

---

### üß† Applies to:

#### 1. ‚úÖ **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling**:

* Once a process starts, it runs till it finishes.
* Aging ensures **waiting low-priority processes** eventually get **high enough priority** to be selected.

#### 2. ‚úÖ **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**:

* A low-priority process can be **preempted**.
* With aging, even if it‚Äôs interrupted, its **priority keeps increasing**, so eventually it becomes **un-preemptable**.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Simple Visual Example:

| Process | Initial Priority | Waiting Time | New Priority    |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| P1      | 10 (lowest)      | 5 units      | 5 (now higher!) |
| P2      | 3                | -            | 3               |

After some time, P1's priority becomes **equal to or higher than P2**, so **it gets CPU time** next.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

* üîÑ **Aging = automatic promotion** of long-waiting processes.
* ‚õî **Prevents starvation** in both preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.
* ‚úÖ Ensures **fairness** without completely removing priority benefits.
