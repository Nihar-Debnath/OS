### ❌ **Disadvantage of MLQ (Multilevel Queue):**

* **Rigid structure (No process movement):**
  In MLQ, once a process is assigned to a queue (like system, interactive, or batch), it **stays there forever**.

* **Problem caused:**

  * **Inflexibility:** If a process changes its behavior (e.g., becomes more interactive), it still stays in the same queue.
  * **Starvation:** Lower-priority queues might never get CPU time if higher-priority queues are always full.

---

### ✅ **Why MLFQ (Multilevel Feedback Queue) is better:**

* **Adaptive structure (Allows process movement):**
  MLFQ **moves processes between queues** based on how much CPU they use or how interactive they are.

* **Improvement offered:**

  * **Flexibility:** It adapts to the changing nature of processes.
  * **Fairness:** Prevents starvation by aging or promoting long-waiting processes.
  * **Efficiency:** Gives priority to short and interactive jobs, improving overall system responsiveness.

### 📌 In short:

**MLQ is fixed and unfair, while MLFQ is dynamic and fair.**

| ----------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ------- | -------- |
| **Design**        | Simple | Complex | Complex | Complex  | Complex    | Simple | Complex | Complex  |

## 🧠 Explanation of Each Feature

### 1. **Design** – Is it simple or complicated to implement?

* **FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve)** and **RR (Round Robin)** are **simple**. Just a queue and basic rules.
* Others like **SJF, PSJF, Priority, MLFQ** are **complex** because:

  * Need tracking of burst times, priorities, queue levels, etc.
  * MLFQ uses **multiple queues and rules to move processes**, so it’s the most complex.

### 2. **Preemption** – Can a process be interrupted?

* **❌ No (Non-preemptive)**: Once a process starts, it **runs till it finishes**.

  * Example: FCFS, SJF, normal Priority.
* **✅ Yes (Preemptive)**: A process can be **paused** if a more important one arrives.

  * MLFQ is preemptive — it **interrupts processes based on queue rules**.

### 3. **Convoy Effect** – Does a slow process block fast ones?

* **✅ Yes**: If one **slow process comes first**, it causes a **traffic jam**.

  * FCFS is a classic example.
  * Even Priority can have convoy effect if low-priority tasks never finish.
* **❌ No**: If the system **quickly switches between tasks**, no long waiting.

  * RR and PSJF avoid this.
* MLFQ **tries to reduce it**, but since it demotes long tasks, **convoy can still happen** in lower queues.

### 4. **Overhead** – Extra work needed by the OS/CPU

* **✅ Yes**: Scheduling logic needs **more CPU time** (overhead).

  * Checking which queue, calculating priorities, moving between queues.
  * MLFQ has **highest overhead** because it:

    * Tracks usage time
    * Switches queues
    * Adjusts priorities dynamically
* **❌ No**: Simpler ones (like FCFS) don’t need much CPU effort.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

| Scheduling Type | Super Simple | Efficient | Dynamic | Fair to All? |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------- | ------------ |
| FCFS            | ✅            | ❌         | ❌       | ❌ (Convoy!)  |
| RR              | ✅            | ✅         | ❌       | ✅ (Fair)     |
| MLFQ            | ❌ (Complex)  | ✅         | ✅       | ✅            |

MLFQ is like the **Swiss Army knife** of schedulers:

* Balances short and long tasks
* Can adapt
* Preemptive
* But needs more work (overhead)
