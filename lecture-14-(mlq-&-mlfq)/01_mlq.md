## 💡 **What is CPU Scheduling and Why Do We Need It?**

Your CPU can execute only one process at a time. But in a real system, there are **many processes** waiting to be executed (system tasks, user apps, background services, etc.).
To handle all of these efficiently, the **operating system (OS)** needs to decide:

> **Which process should run next on the CPU?**

This decision is made by using **CPU scheduling algorithms**, and one of the advanced ones is:

## 🔷 **Multi-Level Queue Scheduling (MLQ)**

### 📌 **Main Idea:**

Instead of having a single waiting line (queue) for processes, we divide them into **multiple separate queues** based on their characteristics like:

* Process type (system, user, background),
* Priority,
* Memory needs,
* Input/output behavior.

### ⚙️ **How It Works Step-by-Step:**

### 🔹 a. **Ready Queue is Divided Into Multiple Queues**

* The **ready queue** (list of processes waiting to use the CPU) is split into **different queues**.
* Each queue is for a **specific kind** of process.

👉 Example Queues:

| Queue Type               | Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| System Process (SP)      | Critical OS tasks (top priority)                 |
| Interactive Process (IP) | Apps needing quick response like browsers, games |
| Batch Process (BP)       | Background jobs like antivirus scans             |

### 🔹 b. **Fixed Assignment of Processes to Queues**

* Once a process is put into a queue, **it stays there forever**.
* Assignment depends on things like:

  * Process priority
  * Whether it’s interactive or background
  * Its memory or CPU usage

> 🔒 No movement between queues. That’s why it’s **inflexible**.

### 🔹 c. **Each Queue Has Its Own Scheduling Algorithm**

* Every queue can use a **different scheduling rule**.

Example:

* System queue → **Strict Priority**
* Interactive queue → **Round Robin (RR)**
* Batch queue → **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**

So, each queue is like its **own mini-scheduler**.

### 🔹 d. **Types of Processes (Detailed):**

* **System Process:**

  * Created by OS.
  * Very high priority.
  * Examples: device drivers, interrupt handlers.

* **Interactive Process (Foreground):**

  * Needs **user interaction**.
  * Should respond quickly (like games or chat apps).

* **Batch Process (Background):**

  * No user interaction.
  * Can run silently when system is free.
  * Examples: backups, virus scanning.

### 🔹 e. **Scheduling Between Queues: Fixed Priority Preemptive**

Here’s the key idea:

> Higher-priority queues are ALWAYS more important than lower-priority ones.

* If a **foreground (interactive)** process enters while a **batch** job is running, the batch job is **interrupted** (preempted), and the foreground job runs.
* This happens even if the batch process was halfway through.

This is called **fixed priority preemptive scheduling**.

### 🔹 f. **Preemption Example:**

Let’s say:

* The CPU is executing a **batch process**.
* Suddenly, an **interactive process** arrives.

✅ The interactive process will immediately **interrupt** and **preempt** the batch process.
✅ The batch job has to wait.

### ⚠️ g. **Problem: Starvation**

* Starvation means a **low-priority process never gets CPU time** because higher-priority queues are always busy.
* In MLQ:

  > Until all system + interactive jobs are finished, batch jobs **won’t even be considered**.

This is a **major drawback** of MLQ.

### 🚨 h. **Convoy Effect is Present**

* Convoy effect means: one slow process delays others.
* For example: If a long batch job is running and a short interactive process arrives **after it's too late to preempt**, others must wait.

## ✅ Why Do We Need Multi-Level Queue Scheduling?

### 👍 **Advantages:**

1. **Separation of Concerns:**

   * Different types of processes are handled differently.
   * Important tasks (like system updates) don’t get delayed by low-priority jobs.

2. **Performance Boost:**

   * Interactive processes get faster responses (smooth user experience).
   * Background tasks don’t interfere with critical ones.

3. **Custom Scheduling:**

   * Each queue can use the best algorithm for its type.
   * Example: Round Robin for user apps, FCFS for long batch jobs.

## 👎 Disadvantages:

1. **Inflexible:**

   * Once assigned to a queue, a process **can’t move** even if its behavior changes.

2. **Starvation Risk:**

   * Low-priority processes may never run.

3. **Convoy Effect:**

   * One slow process can hold up the queue.

## 🧠 Analogy (For Better Understanding):

Imagine a hospital:

* **ICU (System queue)** → Highest attention. Immediate treatment.
* **General ward (Interactive queue)** → Regular but important cases.
* **Check-up clinic (Batch queue)** → Non-urgent, handled when time permits.

Doctors (CPU) always prioritize ICU first, then general ward, and lastly check-up patients.
Even if a check-up patient was waiting for hours, if a critical patient comes in, they get treated first.
