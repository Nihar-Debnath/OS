## 🔢 **Page Table Overview (Point e)**

### i. Definition:

> A data structure that **stores which page is mapped to which frame**.

🔁 So:

* Pages exist in the **logical memory** (process's point of view).
* Frames exist in the **physical memory** (RAM's point of view).
* The **Page Table** maps **each page to a frame**.

---

### ii. Function:

> **The page table contains the base address of each page in physical memory.**

That means for each **page number**, the **table tells you where it is in RAM** (which frame). This is how the system knows how to translate logical memory to physical memory.

---

## 🧠 **How CPU uses the Logical Address (Point f)**

Every **logical address** from the CPU is divided into:

* `p`: **Page number**
* `d`: **Offset** (within that page)

### 🔁 Process:

1. CPU gives logical address like: `p : d`
2. The **MMU** uses `p` to index into the **Page Table**.
3. The Page Table tells which **frame number** to look at.
4. The physical address is then:

   $$
   \text{(Frame number) × (Frame size)} + d
   $$

## 📊 Diagram Explanation

### 🔹 Left Side — Logical Memory of Process P1

It has 4 pages:

* Page 0
* Page 1
* Page 2
* Page 3

### 🔹 Middle — Page Table

This is where the **logical pages** are mapped to **physical frames**:

| Page Number | Frame Number |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 0           | 1            |
| 1           | 4            |
| 2           | 3            |
| 3           | 7            |

So:

* Page 0 is in Frame 1
* Page 1 is in Frame 4
* Page 2 is in Frame 3
* Page 3 is in Frame 7

### 🔹 Right Side — Physical Memory

Frames (RAM blocks) 0 to 7:

* Frame 1 = Page 0
* Frame 3 = Page 2
* Frame 4 = Page 1
* Frame 7 = Page 3

This visualization helps show how **logical memory is scattered** in physical memory, and the **Page Table keeps track** of all of this.

---

## 🗃 (Point g) Where is the Page Table Stored?

> Page table is stored in **main memory (RAM)** during process creation.

This means:

* When a new process is created, the OS builds its page table in memory.
* The **base address** (location in memory where this table starts) is stored in the **PCB (Process Control Block)** — a structure that keeps track of each process.

---

## 🛠 (Point h) What is PTBR?

> **Page Table Base Register (PTBR)** points to the start of the page table in memory.

* It’s a **special CPU register**.
* It stores the **address of the page table**.
* During **context switch** (switching between processes), only the **PTBR needs to be updated** to point to the new process’s page table — very efficient.

---

Explanation of **Point-h** and **point-g** more briefly

### 🟢 Point (g): Where is the Page Table Stored?

Think like this:

* You (the OS) give each **process its own book** (the process).
* Inside that book, there are **chapters** (pages).
* But to **find which chapter is kept in which shelf** (frame in RAM), you need a **mapping table**.

So:

* This **mapping table is called the Page Table**.
* This **Page Table is stored in the main memory (RAM)**.
* And to keep track of where this table is placed in RAM, the OS writes down its **location in the process's ID card** — which is called the **PCB (Process Control Block)**.

📌 **In short:**
👉 Page Table is stored in RAM,
👉 and its **starting address is saved in the PCB** (like tagging where to find the table).

---

### 🟢 Point (h): What is PTBR?

Now, imagine the **CPU needs to use that mapping table** to find out where a chapter is.

But instead of going to RAM and searching randomly, the CPU keeps a **special shortcut** — a **bookmark**.

This shortcut is:

* A **special register in CPU** called **PTBR (Page Table Base Register)**.
* It **directly points to the start of the Page Table** in RAM.

When the CPU **switches to another process** (context switch):

* The OS just needs to **update this one PTBR** to point to the new process’s page table.
* No need to move anything else — fast and efficient.

📌 **In short:**
👉 PTBR is like a **pointer or bookmark** that tells the CPU where the Page Table starts.
👉 When switching processes, you just **change the PTBR**, and the CPU will now read the new process's table.

## 🧠 What is Context Switching (in paging)?

**Context Switching** = Switching the CPU from running **one process** to running **another process**.

Imagine:

* You (the CPU) are reading **Book A (Process A)**.
* Suddenly, your teacher (the OS) says: “Switch to **Book B (Process B)**.”
* But the books are paged (i.e., broken into chapters) and chapters are **scattered in the library (RAM)**.

So now you need to:

1. Close Book A.
2. Remember where you left off.
3. Open Book B.
4. Find its **Page Table** (mapping chapters to shelves in RAM).
5. Start reading from where Book B left off.

---

## 🔁 Steps of Context Switching in Paging

### 🟡 Step 1: Save the old context (of Process A)

* Save:

  * **Program counter** (where the CPU was in Process A)
  * **Register values**
  * **PTBR** (Page Table Base Register — pointer to Process A's page table)

All this is saved in **Process A's PCB (Process Control Block)**.

---

### 🟢 Step 2: Load the new context (of Process B)

* Load:

  * New program counter
  * New register values
  * New **PTBR** (points to Process B’s page table in RAM)

This PTBR now tells the CPU:

> “Hey, if you're trying to read a chapter from Book B, use **this table** to find where its chapters are stored.”

## 🔄 What Actually Changes During Context Switch?

| Component                              | What Happens                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PTBR**                               | Gets updated to point to the new process's page table.              |
| **Registers**                          | Updated to match the state of the new process.                      |
| **Program Counter**                    | Set to where the new process was last paused.                       |
| **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)** | Flushed/invalidated (since it's storing old mappings of Process A). |

### 📌 **Short Answer:**

> **A new PTBR is NOT created.**
> The **same PTBR (Page Table Base Register)** is **updated** with the **page table address of the new process**, which is fetched from the **new PCB**.

---

### 💡 Think of it Like This (Your Analogy):

* There is **only one bookmark (PTBR)** that the CPU uses to know **where to look for the chapter list (page table)**.
* When the teacher (OS) tells you to switch from **Book A (Process A)** to **Book B (Process B)**:

  * You open **Book B’s ID card (PCB)**.
  * From there, you find out where Book B's chapter index (Page Table) is kept.
  * You **move the bookmark (PTBR)** to point to that.

### 🧠 Real System Behavior:

| Component                           | What It Does                                                           |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PCB (Process Control Block)**     | Stores the **base address of the page table** for that process.        |
| **PTBR (Page Table Base Register)** | Points to the **current page table** used by the CPU.                  |
| **Context Switch**                  | CPU loads the **new process’s page table address from PCB into PTBR**. |

So:

* The **PTBR stays the same** — it's like a **register inside the CPU**.
* It just gets a **new value** during a context switch.

---

### ✅ Summary:

* **PTBR is not recreated**, it’s reused.
* The **new process's page table base address** is loaded **from the new PCB into the PTBR**.
* This allows the MMU (Memory Management Unit) to now translate logical addresses **for the new process**.
