## 🧠 What is ASID (Address Space Identifier)?

Every process has its **own virtual address space** (its own page table).

Now imagine this:

* TLB is a cache that stores:

  ```
  page number → frame number
  ```

But if **multiple processes are running**, the same page number (like `page 0`) could mean different things for each process!

That’s where **ASID** comes in.

## 🔹 ASID = Process Tag for TLB Entries

* **ASID is a small unique ID** assigned to each process.
* Every entry in the TLB is **tagged** with an ASID.

  ```
  TLB entry = (ASID, Page Number) → Frame Number
  ```

This tells the TLB:

> “This mapping belongs to **Process X** only!”

## 🔁 What Happens During Context Switching?

Context switching = switching from **Process A** to **Process B**.

Here’s what happens:

### 🔄 Step-by-step:

1. **Process A is running**, and its ASID is active.

   * TLB has entries like:
     `(ASID = A, Page 0) → Frame 3`

2. **Context switch happens** → Now **Process B** starts running.

   * The CPU sets a **new ASID** in the hardware (ASID = B).

3. Now when Process B gives a page number (say Page 0):

   * TLB checks:

     * Is there a `(ASID = B, Page 0)` entry?
   * If **yes** → ✅ TLB hit.
   * If **no** → ❌ TLB miss, go to the page table.

4. So **entries of Process A** stay in TLB, but are **ignored** during B’s execution.

## 💡 Why ASID is So Powerful?

Without ASID:

* TLB would have to be **flushed (emptied)** on every context switch.
* That means 100% TLB misses right after switching.

With ASID:

* TLB can hold mappings for **multiple processes** at once.
* During context switch, just **change the active ASID**.
* Entries for other processes are safely ignored — **no need to flush**.

| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ASID**                  | A tag added to each TLB entry to identify which process it belongs to |
| **Helps with**            | Preventing conflicts between processes using the same page numbers    |
| **During context switch** | Just change the ASID in the CPU — no need to flush the TLB            |
| **Benefit**               | Faster context switching, less TLB miss rate                          |
