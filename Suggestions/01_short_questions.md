**Q1. What is Operating System?**
**Ans:** An operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

**Q2. What is the difference between process and thread?**
**Ans:** A process is an independent program with its own memory space, while a thread is a lightweight process that shares memory with other threads in the same process.

**Q3. What is the purpose of system calls?**
**Ans:** System calls provide the interface between user programs and the operating system to request services like file operations, process management, etc.

**Q4. Define throughput.**
**Ans:** Throughput is the number of processes completed in a given period of time.



**Q5. What is starvation?**
**Ans:** Starvation is a situation where a process waits indefinitely to acquire a resource because other processes are continuously given preference.

**Q6. What is the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?**
**Ans:** In preemptive scheduling, a running process can be interrupted, while in non-preemptive scheduling, a running process runs until it finishes or blocks.

**Q7. What is the main objective of multiprogramming?**
**Ans:** To maximize CPU utilization by executing multiple programs concurrently.

**Q8. Define critical section.**
**Ans:** A critical section is a code segment where shared resources are accessed and must not be executed by more than one process at a time.



**Q9. What is a deadlock?**
**Ans:** Deadlock is a condition where a group of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another.

**Q10. Name the four conditions necessary for deadlock.**
**Ans:** Mutual exclusion, Hold and wait, No preemption, Circular wait.

**Q11. What is page fault?**
**Ans:** A page fault occurs when a program tries to access a page not currently in memory.

**Q12. What is the purpose of a TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)?**
**Ans:** TLB is a cache used to reduce the time taken to access the page table.



**Q13. What is virtual memory?**
**Ans:** Virtual memory is a memory management technique that allows the execution of processes that may not be completely in main memory.

**Q14. What is demand paging?**
**Ans:** Demand paging is a technique where a page is loaded into memory only when it is needed.

**Q15. Define segmentation.**
**Ans:** Segmentation is a memory management scheme that divides memory into segments of variable sizes based on the logical division of a program.

**Q16. What is the purpose of file system?**
**Ans:** The file system manages how data is stored and retrieved on storage devices.



**Q17. What is file descriptor?**
**Ans:** A file descriptor is an integer that uniquely identifies an open file in an operating system.

**Q18. What is the difference between internal and external fragmentation?**
**Ans:** Internal fragmentation is wasted space within allocated memory blocks; external fragmentation is wasted space between allocated blocks.

**Q19. Define I/O scheduling.**
**Ans:** I/O scheduling determines the order in which I/O requests are serviced.

**Q20. What is disk scheduling?**
**Ans:** Disk scheduling is the method used to decide the order of pending disk I/O requests to improve performance.



**Q21. What is context switching?**
**Ans:** Context switching is the process of storing the state of a process and loading the state of another to switch execution.

**Q22. Define kernel.**
**Ans:** The kernel is the core component of an operating system that manages system resources and communication between hardware and software.

**Q23. What is the use of semaphore?**
**Ans:** A semaphore is a synchronization tool used to solve the critical section problem and avoid race conditions.

**Q24. What is the use of PCB (Process Control Block)?**
**Ans:** PCB stores information about a process such as its state, program counter, CPU registers, and memory limits.



**Q25. What is CPU scheduling?**
**Ans:** CPU scheduling is the process of selecting one process from the ready queue to be executed by the CPU.

**Q26. What is the difference between logical and physical address?**
**Ans:** Logical address is generated by the CPU, while physical address is the location in memory.

**Q27. What is the purpose of the Ready Queue?**
**Ans:** It holds all the processes that are ready and waiting to be executed by the CPU.

**Q28. Define system program.**
**Ans:** A system program is software that provides services to the user and to other software, such as compilers, loaders, or editors.



**Q29. What is a booting process?**
**Ans:** Booting is the process of starting a computer and loading the operating system into memory.

**Q30. Define spooling.**
**Ans:** Spooling is a process where data is temporarily held to be used and executed by a device, program, or system.

**Q31. Define time-sharing system.**
**Ans:** A time-sharing system allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously by using time slices.

**Q32. What is swap space?**
**Ans:** Swap space is disk space used as virtual memory when physical RAM is full.
