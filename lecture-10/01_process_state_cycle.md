This diagram shows the **Process State Transition Diagram**, which explains how a program becomes a process and how it moves through different **states during its lifetime** in an operating system.

Let’s go through each state and transition in **very simple terms**:

### 1. **New**
- 📌 **Meaning**: A program has just been created and is waiting to be allowed into the system.
- 📥 **Transition (Admitted)**: The OS decides to accept this program and turn it into a process.

### 2. **Ready**
- 📌 **Meaning**: The process is ready to run and is waiting in the queue for the CPU.
- 🏃‍♂️ **Transition (Scheduler Dispatch)**: The OS scheduler picks this process and gives it the CPU.

### 3. **Running**
- 📌 **Meaning**: The process is currently running on the CPU.
- 🔁 **Interrupt**: If the process's time slice ends or a higher priority process comes in, the OS takes it off the CPU and sends it back to **Ready**.
- 🛑 **Exit**: If the process finishes its work, it goes to the **Terminated** state.
- 📤 **I/O or Event Wait**: If the process needs input/output (e.g. reading from disk), it can't continue and is moved to the **Waiting** state.

### 4. **Waiting** (also called Blocked)
- 📌 **Meaning**: The process is waiting for some event or I/O to complete (e.g., user input, file load).
- ✅ **Transition (I/O or Event Completion)**: When the event or I/O finishes, the process goes back to **Ready**, waiting to be scheduled again.

### 5. **Terminated**
- 📌 **Meaning**: The process has completed its task or has been killed. It is now dead and removed from the system.

### 🔁 Summary in Plain Words:

Imagine a student (process) waiting for their turn to use a library computer (CPU):

1. **New**: The student registers to use the computer.
2. **Ready**: They’re waiting in the queue.
3. **Running**: It's their turn; they start working.
4. If they:
   - Finish → they **leave** (Terminated),
   - Get interrupted → they go **back in the queue** (Ready),
   - Need to print → they wait for the **printer** (Waiting), then return to queue when done.
