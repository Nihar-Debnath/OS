## üß† **Multitasking** (Multiple **Processes**)

### üëâ What it means:
**Doing many tasks at the same time.**

### ‚úÖ Example:
Your computer is:
- Playing music üéµ (Process 1)
- Downloading a file üì• (Process 2)
- Running a browser üåê (Process 3)

Each task is a **separate process**. The operating system quickly switches between them to make it **look like** they‚Äôre happening at the same time. This is **multitasking**.

### üéØ In short:
- Multitasking = Multiple **programs/processes** running at once
- Example: MS Word + YouTube + File Download all open together

## üßµ **Multithreading** (Multiple **Threads** in one Process)

### üëâ What it means:
**Doing many small tasks at the same time inside one program.**

### ‚úÖ Example:
A web browser (like Chrome) is:
- Loading a webpage üñºÔ∏è
- Playing a video üé¨
- Running JavaScript code üíª

All of these are parts of the **same program**, running as **threads** inside one process. This is **multithreading**.

### üéØ In short:
- Multithreading = Multiple **threads/tasks inside one program**
- Example: In MS Word, one thread checks spelling, another saves your file automatically

## üîÑ Difference in One Line:

| Feature          | Multitasking                  | Multithreading                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Based on         | Multiple **processes**        | Multiple **threads in one process** |
| Example          | Chrome + Spotify + Word       | Chrome loading 3 tabs at once       |
| Used for         | Running many programs         | Making one program faster           |

```
so that means process are like diff apps and threads are like diff tabs inside a app, then why does process takes 1 cpu and threads are take more than one cpu, if you thik logically in threads there are only one app is running which means that should use only one cpu, can yopu explain it for me?
```

Excellent question ‚Äî and you're thinking in the **right direction**. Let me explain this step by step in simple logic.


### ‚úÖ First: Yes, you're right.

- A **process** is like a whole **app** (e.g., Chrome).
- **Threads** are like **tabs** or smaller tasks inside that app (e.g., YouTube, Gmail, etc.).

Now let‚Äôs understand **why threads can use multiple CPUs**, even if they belong to just **one app/process**.


### üîß Step-by-Step Logic:

#### 1. üß† CPU cores don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúapps‚Äù ‚Äî they run *tasks*

Each **CPU core** can run **one thread** at a time. So the OS assigns **threads** to cores ‚Äî not the entire app.

So even if one app (one process) creates **multiple threads**, those threads can be spread across **multiple CPU cores**.


#### 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Think of the process as a **container**

The process is just a container:
- It holds memory, code, data, and threads.
- But the actual *work* is done by threads.

> So when you say ‚Äúonly one app is running,‚Äù it may have **many workers (threads)** doing tasks in parallel ‚Äî like multiple tabs in Chrome loading at the same time.


### üî• Real Example: Google Chrome

- Chrome (1 process) can have **20+ threads** running (tabs, network requests, UI rendering).
- On a **4-core CPU**, 4 threads can run *at the exact same time* ‚Äî one per core.
- The OS splits the workload across cores for performance.


### üß† Conclusion (Simple Summary):

| Concept      | Works On      | Why It Uses More CPUs |
|--------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Process**  | Like a full app | Only 1 main task/thread at first |
| **Thread**   | Tiny task in app | Each thread can run on a different CPU core |

‚úÖ So even if only **one app (process)** is running, if it has **many threads**, it **can use many CPU cores** at once.

In multi-tasking there is isolation and memory protection is available, on the other hand in multi-threading there is no isolation and memory peotection why? can you explain it.
```

Yes ‚Äî that‚Äôs a **very good observation**, and it‚Äôs an important concept in operating systems. Let‚Äôs break it down in a **simple and clear way**.

## üîí 1. Why Multitasking Has **Isolation and Memory Protection**

In **multitasking**, each **process**:
- Has its **own separate memory space**
- Runs **independently** from others
- Can‚Äôt access memory of other processes directly

‚û°Ô∏è **Reason:**  
The OS (Operating System) uses **memory protection** (via the Memory Management Unit or MMU) to keep processes **isolated**.  
This prevents a faulty or malicious process from crashing or corrupting others.

### üß† Think of it like:
> Each process is in its **own private room** with a lock. No one else can enter.

## üîì 2. Why Multithreading Has **No Isolation or Memory Protection**

In **multithreading**, all **threads** belong to **one process**.

They:
- **Share the same memory space** (code, data, heap)
- Can **read and write** to the same variables
- Have **no memory walls** between them

‚û°Ô∏è **Reason:**  
Threads are **meant to cooperate**, not compete. They work **together** inside the same process to do multiple tasks **efficiently**.

### üß† Think of it like:
> All threads live in the **same room** and can access **everything** freely.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What‚Äôs the Risk?

- Because threads **share memory**, if one thread writes bad data or crashes, it can **affect all other threads** in the process.
- That‚Äôs why **thread safety** and **locks/mutexes** are important in multithreaded programming.

## üéØ Summary Table:

| Feature              | Multitasking (Processes)      | Multithreading (Threads)         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Memory Isolation     | ‚úÖ Yes (separate memory)        | ‚ùå No (shared memory)             |
| OS-level Protection  | ‚úÖ Yes                          | ‚ùå No                             |
| Communication        | Slow (via IPC)                | Fast (shared variables)          |
| Risk of Crash Spread | ‚ùå Less                        | ‚úÖ High if not handled properly   |

So nowadays if i open my bank server in one tab and on other tab i am using a pirate website for downloading movies, do they will can access my bank server which i opened to check my balance?
```

Excellent and important question. The **short answer is: No, one browser tab cannot directly access another tab‚Äôs content**, **even if both are in the same browser** ‚Äî thanks to **strong security models built into modern browsers**.

Let‚Äôs break it down simply.

## ‚úÖ What Keeps You Safe: **Browser Security Model**

### 1. üîê **Process Isolation (Site Isolation)**  
Modern browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) run **each tab as a separate process**.

- Your bank‚Äôs tab runs in **its own process**.
- The pirate website runs in a **different process**.
- Each process is **isolated**, like apps in different locked rooms.

So even if the pirate site is malicious, it **cannot read** what's in your bank tab.

### 2. üåê **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**  
This is a browser rule that **prevents one website from accessing data from another website**.

> Only pages with the **same domain, protocol, and port** can interact with each other.

So:
- `https://yourbank.com` **cannot be read by** `http://pirate-site.com`
- The browser simply blocks such attempts.

### 3. üß∞ **Sandboxes and Permissions**  
Browsers also:
- Run web pages in a **sandbox** (limited access to system resources)
- Ask for **permissions** if a site tries to access things like camera, location, etc.
- Prevent one tab from directly interfering with another tab‚Äôs content

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Are the Real Risks?

Even though your bank tab is isolated:
- **If your system is infected** with malware or keyloggers ‚Äî that‚Äôs outside the browser ‚Äî **your data can be at risk.**
- If you **download something malicious** from the pirate site (e.g., cracked software or fake browser extensions), it could harm your device or steal information indirectly.

So the pirate site can‚Äôt read your bank tab directly, but it **can harm your system** in other ways.

## ‚úÖ How to Stay Safe:

- Use **up-to-date browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Avoid downloading from **untrusted sources**
- Keep your **OS and antivirus** up to date
- Use **Incognito Mode** for extra privacy (though not for security)
- Don't install **unknown browser extensions**

```
so when i downloads any pirated movies from that website, do i am harming my pc, phone
```

Yes ‚Äî **downloading pirated movies** from untrusted websites can absolutely **harm your PC or phone**, even if the file looks safe. Here's why:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Why It‚Äôs Dangerous**

### 1. **Malware Hidden in Files**
Pirated websites often bundle:
- **Trojans** (give hackers control over your device)
- **Keyloggers** (record what you type ‚Äî including passwords)
- **Ransomware** (locks your files and demands money)
- **Spyware** (silently watches what you do)

Even if the file name ends in `.mp4` (video), it could be a **fake** or packed with hidden threats in:
- ZIP/RAR files
- Cracked player installers
- Subtitles or codecs that ask you to "install something"

### 2. **Fake Download Buttons**
These sites often show **misleading ads** that look like "Download" buttons, but actually download malware instead.

### 3. **Mobile Risk (Phones)**
On phones:
- If you install APKs (Android apps) from pirate sources, they may contain **spyware or backdoors**.
- iPhones are safer, but jailbroken devices are vulnerable.

### 4. **No Legal or Security Support**
You're downloading from a **criminal source**. There's:
- No guarantee it's clean
- No updates or fixes
- No legal protection if something goes wrong

## üîí What Could Go Wrong:

| Risk | Example |
|------|---------|
| System slowdown | Hidden crypto miners using your CPU |
| Password theft | Bank, email, or social media logins stolen |
| Webcam access | Malware spying through your webcam |
| Ransomware | All your files encrypted, ransom demanded |
| Internet spying | Monitoring what you browse or type |

## ‚úÖ How to Stay Safe:

- Use **legal streaming services** (many free ones like YouTube, Hotstar, MX Player, etc.)
- Never download from shady sites, especially ones that require extra apps/codecs.
- If you really must download media: use **reputable, legal sources** only.
- Keep your antivirus and OS updated.
