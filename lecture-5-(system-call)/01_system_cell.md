No problem! Let me explain the concept of **System Calls** from your lecture note (titled *LEC-5: System Calls*) in **very simple and detailed terms**, step by step.

## üß† What is a System Call?

Imagine your **computer as a building**, and the **operating system‚Äôs kernel** is a **restricted control room** inside that building. The **user programs (apps)** are like people working outside this control room. Now, if someone wants to perform a restricted operation‚Äîlike turning off the lights (hardware control), or opening a locked file cabinet (file system)‚Äîthey can‚Äôt just go inside the control room. Instead, they have to **press a button (a system call)** to request help from the inside.

So in short:

> üí° **A system call is a special way for a user program to request a service from the operating system‚Äôs kernel.**

## ü§î Why are System Calls Needed?

User programs run in **User Mode**, which is a safe, restricted environment. They are not allowed to:
- Directly talk to hardware (keyboard, printer, etc.)
- Access memory freely
- Manage files directly

Only the **Kernel**, which runs in **Kernel Mode**, can do those things.

So when a program (like a browser or text editor) needs to do something that requires kernel access (like reading a file or creating a new process), it must make a **system call**.

## üìå Examples from the Note

### 1. **Creating a Directory (`mkdir`)**
- When you type `mkdir newfolder` in Linux, this command **doesn‚Äôt directly create the folder**.
- It **calls a function** (like `mkdir()`) from the **C library (glibc)**.
- That function is a **wrapper** ‚Äî it internally makes a **system call** to the kernel‚Äôs file system service.
- Then the kernel creates the actual directory.

So you ‚Üí `mkdir()` ‚Üí system call ‚Üí kernel ‚Üí creates folder.

### 2. **Creating a Process**
- A user runs a program like a browser.
- That starts in **User Space (User Mode)**.
- The program makes a system call to `exec()` (or similar) to create a process.
- The kernel receives that system call and creates a new process (now in **Kernel Space**).
- After the kernel is done, control is returned to the user space.

## üîÅ What Happens Technically (Step-by-Step)

Let's break it down with the diagram in your note:

1. **User App**: You run a program like `ls` or `mkdir`.
2. **Glibc**: This is the standard C library. It provides functions like `open()`, `read()`, `fork()`, etc.
   - These functions are not actual system calls but **call the actual system calls internally**.
3. **Software Interrupt**: This is the technical trick that switches the CPU from user mode to kernel mode.
4. **System Call Interface (SCI)**:
   - Acts like a **reception desk** that receives system call requests.
   - Passes the request to the actual kernel functions.
5. **Kernel**:
   - Executes the request (like opening a file or creating a process).
6. **Hardware (if needed)**: If it involves I/O (e.g., reading a file), the kernel may talk to the hardware.
7. **Return to User Mode**: After the task is done, control is sent back to the user program.

## üîê Why This is Safe

- **User Mode** limits the damage an app can do (no accidental deletion of system files).
- **Kernel Mode** has full access, so system calls act like **security-checked bridges** that allow only specific, safe interactions.

## üìù Summary

- **System Calls** are the *only* way user programs talk to the operating system's core (kernel).
- They are implemented in **C**, often using the standard library (`glibc`) as wrappers.
- They help with things like **file operations**, **process control**, **memory access**, and **device communication**.
- Example system calls: `read()`, `write()`, `fork()`, `exec()`, `exit()`, `open()`.
