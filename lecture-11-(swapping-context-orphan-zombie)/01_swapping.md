## üß† First, What is Swapping?

Swapping is a **memory management technique** used by operating systems (like Windows, Linux, etc.).

Imagine your computer has **limited memory (RAM)**. You‚Äôre running many programs, but there isn‚Äôt enough space in the RAM for all of them to stay active at the same time. So what does the computer do?

It **temporarily removes some programs (or parts of them) from the RAM** and **stores them on the hard drive or SSD (called secondary memory)**. This process is called **swapping out**. Later, when the removed program is needed again, the operating system **loads it back into RAM**. This is called **swapping in**.

## üîç Now Let‚Äôs Explain Each Point (a to f) in Detail

### a. *"Time-sharing system may have medium term scheduler (MTS)."*

* A **time-sharing system** is one where **many users** (or processes) are using the computer at the same time.
* To manage this, the operating system uses different **schedulers**.
* The **Medium Term Scheduler (MTS)** is one such manager. It decides **which processes should be swapped out or in** of memory.
* So, **MTS helps control memory load** by temporarily removing or bringing back processes based on memory availability.

### b. *"Remove processes from memory to reduce degree of multi-programming."*

* **Multi-programming** means keeping many processes in memory so the CPU stays busy.
* But if there are **too many**, the system slows down.
* So, to keep things efficient, **some processes are removed (swapped out)** from RAM.
* This **frees up space** in memory for more important or active programs.

### c. *"These removed processes can be reintroduced into memory, and its execution can be continued where it left off. This is called Swapping."*

* The process that was **swapped out** is **not deleted or stopped**. It‚Äôs just paused and saved.
* When the system has memory space again, it **brings the process back** (swap-in).
* It **remembers where the process left off** and **continues from there**, like pressing "pause" and then "play".

### d. *"Swap-out and swap-in is done by MTS."*

* Remember the **Medium Term Scheduler (MTS)**?
* It‚Äôs the part of the operating system that decides **when to swap out** a process and **when to swap in** a process.
* So MTS manages this whole swapping activity.

### e. *"Swapping is necessary to improve process mix or because a change in memory requirements has overcommitted available memory, requiring memory to be freed up."*

* Sometimes, you might start a heavy process or multiple processes.
* This might cause **memory overload**.
* So the OS has to **free up space** for the new or active processes by **swapping out less active ones**.
* This helps maintain a good **balance of active processes** in memory (called **process mix**).

### f. *"Swapping is a mechanism in which a process can be swapped temporarily out of main memory (or move) to secondary storage (disk) and make that memory available to other processes. At some later time, the system swaps back the process from the secondary storage to main memory."*

* This is a complete definition of **Swapping**.
* Let‚Äôs break it down even further:

  * A **process** (a running program) is **moved out of RAM**.
  * It is stored on the **hard disk/SSD** (secondary storage).
  * This **frees RAM** for other programs to use.
  * Later, when needed, the system brings that process **back into RAM**.
  * The process then **resumes execution**.

## üß© Now Let‚Äôs Explain the Diagram in Detail

The diagram shows **how processes move** between memory, CPU, and storage during swapping:

1. **Partially executed swapped-out processes** (Top Box):

   * These are the processes that were **paused and moved out** of RAM.
   * They are stored in **secondary storage**.

2. **Swap-in** (Arrow going down):

   * When the system needs this process again and there's space in RAM, it **brings it back** to memory.
   * The process is moved into the **Ready Queue**.

3. **Ready Queue** (Middle box):

   * This is a **list of all processes ready to be executed by the CPU**.
   * Once in the ready queue, the process waits for its turn.

4. **CPU** (Circle):

   * The process now goes to the **CPU**, gets executed.
   * It can either **complete** (go to the "end") or need I/O (Input/Output) operations.

5. **I/O Waiting Queue**:

   * If the process needs to read/write from a file or do other I/O, it moves to the **I/O waiting queue**.
   * Once I/O is done, it can go back to the ready queue or be swapped out again.

6. **Swap-out** (Arrow going up from CPU):

   * If memory is full or the process is idle, it can be **swapped out again** and stored back in secondary storage.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Analogy to Help You Understand

Imagine you‚Äôre in a restaurant with limited tables (RAM).

* A group is sitting at a table (process in RAM).
* New customers arrive but there‚Äôs no space.
* The manager politely asks one group to wait outside temporarily (swapping out).
* This makes room for the new group to be seated (new process in RAM).
* When a table is free again, the manager brings the previous group back in to finish their meal (swapping in).

The **restaurant manager = Medium Term Scheduler (MTS)**.
The **tables = main memory (RAM)**.
The **waiting area = secondary storage (disk)**.
