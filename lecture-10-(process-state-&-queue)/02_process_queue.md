### 🔁 What is a "Queue" in OS?

A **queue** is just a **line of waiting processes** — like people standing in different lines for different things.

Now let’s look at the 3 main types of process queues in super simple language:

## 🧳 a. **Job Queue** — "The Newcomers Line"
- Imagine a **group of programs** sitting in **storage (like your hard disk)**, waiting to be allowed into RAM (main memory).
- These are **newly submitted jobs**.
- A special helper called the **Long-Term Scheduler (LTS)** decides **which ones get to come into the main memory** and become active processes.

📌 Think of it like students **registering online** to join a class — only a few are selected to actually attend.

## 🏃 b. **Ready Queue** — "The Ready-to-Work Line"
- These are processes that are now in **main memory**, ready to run, just **waiting for their turn on the CPU**.
- A **Short-Term Scheduler (CPU Scheduler)** picks one from this line and sends it to the **CPU** to actually do the work.

📌 Like students are sitting in a classroom, hands raised, waiting for the teacher (CPU) to pick one to answer a question.

## ⏳ c. **Waiting Queue** — "The Waiting-for-Something Line"
- These are processes that were working but **got stuck** because they’re **waiting for something** (like a file to load or input from keyboard).
- They’re not ready to use the CPU until that thing is done.

📌 Like a student has raised a question but now waits for the teacher to bring a book to answer it — they can’t continue until they get it.

### 🎯 Summary (1 line each):

- **Job Queue**: Programs **waiting to enter memory** (in storage).
- **Ready Queue**: Processes in memory, **waiting for CPU**.
- **Waiting Queue**: Processes **waiting for I/O** (like file or input).
