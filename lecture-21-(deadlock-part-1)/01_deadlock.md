## üß© What is a Deadlock?

A **deadlock** is like a traffic jam, but between computer programs.

Imagine two people:

* Person A has a pen and wants paper.
* Person B has paper and wants the pen.

Both are waiting for the other to give up what they‚Äôre holding ‚Äî but **neither gives it up**, so they **both get stuck forever**.
That‚Äôs a **deadlock**!

---

## ‚ùìWhy Does Deadlock Happen?

Deadlock happens when:

1. A program takes something it needs to work (like a file or memory).
2. Then it asks for something else, but that thing is already being used by another program.
3. Both programs keep waiting for each other to give up their stuff ‚Äî **but no one lets go**.
4. So they‚Äôre stuck, doing nothing forever.

---

## üß± What Must Happen for a Deadlock to Occur?

For this ‚Äústuck forever‚Äù situation to happen, four things usually go wrong:

1. **Only one can use it at a time** (like one person can use the bathroom at a time).
2. **A program holds something and wants more** (like holding the TV remote and asking for the charger).
3. **It can‚Äôt be forced to give up what it has** (no one can grab the remote from your hand).
4. **It forms a circle** ‚Äî everyone is waiting for the next person to give up their thing.

## üì∏ What‚Äôs Happening in the Diagram?

Look at the picture in the screenshot:

* There are **two programs** (`T1` and `T2`).
* There are **two resources** (`R1` and `R2`), which you can think of as tools they need.

Here's the story:

* `T1` has `R1` and is asking for `R2`.
* `T2` has `R2` and is asking for `R1`.

Now both are **waiting for the other to let go** ‚Äî and **neither one ever does**.
So both are stuck, and the work **never gets done**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Why is This a Problem?

* It‚Äôs a **bug** ‚Äî something went wrong in how programs are written.
* The system gets stuck ‚Äî programs **never finish**.
* Other jobs **can‚Äôt start** because the system is busy waiting forever.

---

## üì¶ What are ‚Äúresources‚Äù?

Resources are **things programs need to do their work**, like:

* Memory
* CPU time
* Files
* Internet connections
* Printers

---

## üö¶How Do Programs Use Resources?

1. **Ask**: ‚ÄúCan I use this?‚Äù
2. **Use**: ‚ÄúOkay, I'm working with it.‚Äù
3. **Release**: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done, someone else can use it now.‚Äù

But if a program never reaches step 3, others **can‚Äôt move forward**. That‚Äôs where deadlock happens.

### **1. In Multi-programming environment, we have several processes competing for finite number of resources**

#### ‚úÖ Explanation:

* In a **multi-programming system**, many programs (called **processes**) run at the same time.
* Each of these processes **needs system resources** like memory, CPU, files, I/O devices, etc.
* But the number of these resources is **limited** (finite). For example, there might be **only 1 printer** or **2 CPUs**.
* So, processes **compete** with each other to get access to these resources.

---

### **2. Process requests a resource (R), if R is not available (taken by other process), process enters in a waiting state. Sometimes that waiting process is never able to change its state because the resource it has requested is busy (forever), called DEADLOCK (DL)**

#### ‚úÖ Explanation:

* A process may say, ‚ÄúI need **Resource R** to continue.‚Äù
* If another process is already **using R**, then this process has to **wait**.
* Ideally, it waits until R becomes free.
* But sometimes, R **never becomes free** because the other process **never releases** it (maybe it's waiting for another resource too).
* This leads to a situation where the process is stuck **forever** in the waiting state.
* This situation is known as **Deadlock** ‚Äì where processes wait **forever**, and nothing moves forward.

---

### **3. Two or more processes are waiting on some resource‚Äôs availability, which will never be available as it is also busy with some other process. The Processes are said to be in Deadlock.**

#### ‚úÖ Explanation:

* Deadlock usually involves **two or more** processes.
* Let‚Äôs say:

  * Process A is holding **Resource X** and wants **Resource Y**.
  * Process B is holding **Resource Y** and wants **Resource X**.
* Both are **waiting on each other**, and neither can continue.
* Since neither will ever release what the other needs, both are stuck. This is exactly what a **deadlock** is.

---

### **4. DL is a bug present in the process/thread synchronization method.**

#### ‚úÖ Explanation:

* DL = Deadlock.
* A **bug** is an error in a program or system.
* **Synchronization** is how processes manage shared resources (so they don‚Äôt all try to use the same thing at once).
* When synchronization is not properly handled, it can result in a **deadlock**.
* This makes **deadlock a type of bug** caused by poor process coordination.

---

### **5. In DL, processes never finish executing, and the system resources are tied up, preventing other jobs from starting.**

#### ‚úÖ Explanation:

* When processes are in **deadlock**, they **never complete**.
* They keep waiting **forever**.
* Meanwhile, the resources they are holding are also **not available** to others.
* So, **other jobs** that need those resources **can‚Äôt start**.
* This reduces the efficiency of the system and **wastes resources**.

---

### **6. Example of resources: Memory space, CPU cycles, files, locks, sockets, IO devices etc.**

#### ‚úÖ Explanation:

* The resources that processes need can be:

  * **Memory space** ‚Äì to store data.
  * **CPU cycles** ‚Äì to execute code.
  * **Files** ‚Äì like reading or writing a file.
  * **Locks** ‚Äì used in programming to control access to shared data.
  * **Sockets** ‚Äì for network communication.
  * **I/O devices** ‚Äì like printers, keyboards, disks, etc.

---

### **7. Single resource can have multiple instances of that. E.g., CPU is a resource, and a system can have 2 CPUs.**

#### ‚úÖ Explanation:

* A resource can have **multiple copies (instances)**.
* Example:

  * **CPU** is a resource.
  * A computer may have **2 CPUs (cores)**.
* This means **2 processes** can use the CPU at the same time ‚Äî one on each core.
* But still, the number is **limited**. If 3 processes request the CPU at the same time, one of them has to wait.

---

### **8. How a process/thread utilize a resource?**

Let‚Äôs go into each subpoint.

---

### **a. Request: Request the R, if R is free Lock it, else wait till it is available.**

#### ‚úÖ Explanation:

* A process first **requests** the resource (R).
* If the resource is **free**, it **locks** it ‚Äî meaning it starts using it.
* If the resource is **not free**, it must **wait** until it becomes available.

---

### **b. Use**

#### ‚úÖ Explanation:

* After successfully acquiring the resource, the process **uses it**.
* For example, if the resource is a file, it might read or write to it.

---

### **c. Release: Release resource instance and make it available for other processes**

#### ‚úÖ Explanation:

* Once the process is **done using** the resource, it should **release** it.
* This means the resource becomes **free** for **other processes to use**.

### üß† Diagram at the Bottom

This is a **resource allocation graph**, showing a deadlock scenario.

* **T1** and **T2** are threads (or processes).
* **R1** and **R2** are resources.

Let‚Äôs follow the arrows:

* T1 is **holding R1** (see arrow from R1 to T1 labeled "allocated").
* T1 wants **R2** (see arrow from T1 to R2 labeled "Req").
* T2 is **holding R2** (arrow from R2 to T2).
* T2 wants **R1** (arrow from T2 to R1).

Now both are:

* **Holding one resource**
* **Waiting for the other**

This creates a **circular wait**, which is one of the four necessary conditions for a **deadlock**. Therefore, the system is in a **deadlock state**.
